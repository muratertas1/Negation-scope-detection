## Introduction

This repository contains scripts related to negation scope detection and evaluation as described in the *SEM 2012 Shared Task. Our task was to preprocess the STARSEM CD-SCO corpus, extract features from the data, use feature-based and transformer-based classifiers to carry out negation scope detection, and evaluate the models' peformance in a token-based and span-based manner.

## SCRIPTS

### 1. Data reformatting and analysis-related scripts:
- conll_reformat.py: 
This script can preprocess the raw TXT data, extract negation information, create copies of sentences with more than one negation, and save the processed data to a new TSV file. The script adjusts each sentence ID to be unique for sentences that contain a negation cue. The operations in the script include reducing the original 16 columns to 10 columns. Syntactical information in column 7 was processed to make it compatible for parsing with NLTK. A function is included to combine the two separate test files into one.

- data_distribution_stats.py
This script calculates and prints out statistical information for the preprocessed corpus. It computes the number of tokens, sentences, negated sentences, negation cues, unique negation cues, scopes, and percentage of negated sentences within the corpus.

### 2. Feature-based model-related scripts (CRF):
- constituency_features_extract.py:
This script extracts lexical and syntactic constituency-related features from the input file and writes a new TSV file, where a new column is added for each additional feature. It processes each sentence by parsing its syntactic structure, calculating syntactic distance, clause membership, phrase membership, punctuation, position in the sentence, negation cue status, and distance to the closest negation cue for each token. The resulting features are extracted for each token in each sentence and the sentences are written out to a new TSV file with the added features.

- dependency_features_extract.py:
This script takes a TSV file with constituency features (output of constituency_features_extract.py), processes the sentences, analyzes the dependency relationships in each sentence using SpaCy, and adds 4 additional columns to each line in the files indicating dependency relation, dependency head, dependency distance to root, dependency distance to first negation cue within the sentence.

- crf_feature_ablation.py:
This script utilizes a CRF model for negation scope detection. It reads, formats, extracts features and labels from the input data, then trains and evaluates the CRF model's performance on a token level for precision, recall, and F1 score. It also conducts a feature ablation study to assess the impact of each feature on the model's performance. This is conducted by systematically removing one feature at a time and indicating its impact on the F1 score.

- crf_finetuning.py:
This script utilizes a CRF model for negation scope detection. It reads, formats, and extracts features and labels from the input data, then trains the model, carries out scope detection on unseen data, and evaluates the CRF model's performance on a token level using precision, recall, and F1 score. The script allows for hyper-parameter tuning by performing a grid search over the 'c1' and 'c2' parameters to optimize the model's performance given the selected set of features. It chooses the best-performing hyperparameter combination based on the F1-score.

- crf_model_all_features.py:
This script utilizes a CRF model for negation scope detection. It reads, formats, and extracts features and labels from the input data, then trains the model, carries out scope detection on unseen data, and evaluates the CRF model's performance on a token level using precision, recall, and F1 score. It utilizes all eighteen extracted features, including lexical, constituency-based and dependency-based features.

- crf_model_dep_features.py:
This script utilizes a CRF model for negation scope detection. It reads, formats, and extracts features and labels from the input data, then trains the model, carries out scope detection on unseen data, and evaluates the CRF model's performance on a token level using precision, recall, and F1 score. It utilizes only a selected set of features: lexical and constituency-based features.

- crf_model_constituency_features.py:
This script utilizes a CRF model for negation scope detection. It reads, formats, and extracts features and labels from the input data, then trains the model, carries out scope detection on unseen data, and evaluates the CRF model's performance on a token level using precision, recall, and F1 score. It utilizes only a selected set of features: lexical and dependency-based features.

### 3. Transformer-based model related scripts:

- bert_fine_tuning.ipynb:
This notebook includes all the steps required for fine-tuning a DistilBERT model for the task of negation scope detection. After training, the model is evaluated and the predictions of the model are written into a TSV file.

- bert_preprocessing.py:
This script transforms a previously preprocessed TSV file (output of conll_reformat.py) and adds a special CUE_X token to mark negation cue tokens. The output is written to a new TSV file, which serves as input for bert_fine_tuning.ipynb.

- bert_postprocessing.py:
This script transforms the direct output of bert_fine_tuning.ipynb by rejoining subtokens and saves the data to a new TSV file.

- find_discrepancies_tokenlength.py:
This script served as aid for adjusting the script bert_postprocessing.py. It analyses the sentences in 2 TSV files and prints out the sentences that do not have an equal number of tokens.

### 4. Evaluation related scripts:

- evaluation_metrics.py: 
This script calculates token-based and span-based precision, recall, and F1 scores based on a pairwise comparison between the model-generated file and the file containing gold labels. It creates and displays confusion matrices for both token-level and span-level comparisons.

- evaluation_metrics_bert.py: 
This script calculates token-based and span-based precision, recall, and F1 scores based on a pairwise comparison between gold labels and predicted labels by a transformer-based model. The script assumes that gold labels and predictions are located in the same file in separate columns. It creates and displays confusion matrices for both token-level and span-level comparisons. This script can also be utilized to assess the annotations by Group B.

- extract_errors.py:
This script extracts the erronous sentences from the output of the fine-tuned DistilBERT model on the test set, writes the erronous sentences into a new TSV file based on error categories, such as FN. The output of this script can be utilized for error analysis.
